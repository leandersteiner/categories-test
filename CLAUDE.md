This project is a small test to showcase a feature suggestion to our current ecommerce system.
The language for the backend is golang using the net/http package.
The frontend should be written in react with typescript.
Since this is just going to be a demo the implementation will be minimal and not production ready.
Data can be stored in memory, we dont want to use a database for this demo.
